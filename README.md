Lunar Lander Deep Reinforcement Learning

Problem
The objective of this project is to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train an agent capable of solving the Lunar Lander problem in OpenAI Gym’s "LunarLander-v2" environment. The goal is for the agent to learn to safely land a lunar module between two designated flags, optimizing for control and precision during descent.

Overview
In this project, we implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to solve the "LunarLander-v2" environment. The DQN model approximates Q-values to guide the agent's actions, incorporating key components such as experience replay and target network updates to stabilize training and improve learning efficiency. Through extensive training, the agent learns to maximize rewards by controlling the lunar module’s descent to achieve successful landings.

Key Concepts:
Environment: "LunarLander-v2" (OpenAI Gym)
Algorithm: Deep Q-Network (DQN)
Mechanisms: Experience Replay, Target Network Updates
