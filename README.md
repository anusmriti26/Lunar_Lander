The Lunar Lander environment simulates the landing of a small rocket on the moonâ€™s surface, challenging the agent to land safely. 
This environment, available on the [Gymnasium (OpenAI) website](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), that for testing reinforcement learning algorithms. 
This code utilizes DQN (Deep Q-Network) to train an agent in the Lunar Lander environment, enabling it to learn optimal actions for a safe landing. Key techniques like experience replay and target network updates are implemented to enhance training stability and efficiency.
